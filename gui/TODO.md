# GUI Todo

## Short Term

1. Finish prototype tkinter GUI
2. Replace radiobuttons with colored squares and labels to avoid styling issues
3. Cleanup code in win_gui by seperating frames into seperate classes
4. Test on Windows to make sure it works on the desired OS

## Long Term

1. Duplicate stdout and stderr to a pseudo-terminal within the gui so that user can see logs and errors in real time.
