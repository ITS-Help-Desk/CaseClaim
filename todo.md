# TODO

1. Refactor all commands that generate generic graphs (leadstats, ...) to accept making changes only using SQL connector
2. On a get request, generate a fresh graph and render it out to the user via templating
3. Organize the DOM such that the site makes sense
4. Add style
5. Fix issue where bot command line output is not captured by `get_buffered_inputs()`
